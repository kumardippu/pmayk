                    <p><strong>Prime Minister Narendra Modi</strong> launched a nationwide housing scheme known as <strong>Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.</strong> House is the primary need of every individual. A house is a secure place where one can relax his or her mind and body after the whole day’s struggle and prepare for the next day’s work. A house is a place where new dreams are born and nurtured. Thus it is the basic need of human being from huts to modern multistoried building- all are testimony of what a house means.
The beneficiary of this scheme will embrace husband, wife and unmarried children. The beneficiary family should not own a pucca house either in his/her name or in the name of any member of his/her family in any part of India. 
The mission will meet the housing requirement of urban poor including slum dwellers through following programme verticals:
